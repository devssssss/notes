SSH, or Secure Shell Protocol, is red procol a remote administration protocol that allows users to access, control, and modify their remote servers over the internet.

The SSH connection is implemented using a client-server model. This means that for an SSH connection to be established, the remote machine must be running a piece of software called an SSH daemon. This software listens for connections on a specific network port, authenticates connection requests, and generates the appropriate environment if the user provides the correct credentials.

The user's computer must have an SSH client. This is a piece of software that knows how to communicate using the SSH protocol and can be given information about the remote host to connect to, the username to use, and the credentials to pass to authenticate. The client can also specify details about the type of connection they would like to establish.
